<p> Marta Gómez-Chiarri is an aquatic pathologist and Professor at the University of Rhode Island (URI), where she has been since 1997. Marta earned her Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular 
    Biology from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) in 1992.Previous to joining URI, she was a postdoctoral fellow at Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, where she worked 
    with biotechnological approaches to the culture of several aquatic species, including trout and abalone. Marta held the position of Chair of the Department of Fisheries, Animal, and  
    Veterinary Sciences (2014 – 2020) and is currently the Graduate Coordinator for programs in the areas of Aquaculture and Fisheries and Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems. She is 
    also coordinator of the interdisciplinary Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems undergraduate program, a major that explores the food chain, from farm to plate to waste and back, 
    emphasizing sustainability, impacts on human health, and resilience from economic, environmental, and societal viewpoints. Marta’s research interests include the use of multidisciplinary 
    approaches to the prevention and management of diseases in marine organisms, from probiotics and microbial-microbial interactions to genomics and comparative immunology. Her collaborative 
    national and international research on marine diseases is driven by a desire to ensure equitable access to healthy food that is sustainably produced.  She has published more than 70 
    peer-reviewed articles, consistently secures funding from federal agencies averaging $300,000 annually, and has trained 14 Masters in Science and 12 Ph.D. students, and 10 postdoctoral 
    fellows.  Marta is a member of the Eastern Oyster Genome consortium, and responsible for the coordination of the sequencing of the genome. She is also a member of the East Coast Shellfish 
    Breeding Consortium.  Marta is the recipient of three URI Outstanding Contributions to Intellectual Property awards (2006, 2014, 2019), a URI Excellence Award in Intellectual Property 
    (2012), the College ofthe Environment and Life Sciences Research (2010) and Teaching Excellence (2003) awards, and a Sloan Foundation Certificate of Appreciation for efforts in diversifying 
    graduate education (2007).
